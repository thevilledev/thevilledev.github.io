# Vault secrets plugin for Vercel

I prefer ephemeral tokens but Vercel does not support them out-of-the-box. So I wrote a plugin for Vault called [vault-plugin-secrets-vercel](https://github.com/thevilledev/vault-plugin-secrets-vercel).

# Open source

Whenever I have the time I contribute to Github projects I personally use and like. Very often a HashiCorp repository.

# Automated deployments for Bitcoin Lightning network nodes

Project on Github: [thevilledev/lightning-node-ansible](https://github.com/thevilledev/lightning-node-ansible).

# Getting started with Vault

[Vault](https://vaultproject.io) solves the problem of secrets management and secure introduction in
a really neat way. My project [thevilledev/hashistack-pki](https://github.com/thevilledev/hashistack-pki)
introduces how Hashicorp's tools fit together and how you can utilize internal TLS certificates
easily within your own infrastructure.

# Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) presents math problems which can be solved programmatically. I use C, C++ or Python for these problems.

My solutions can be found from Github: [thevilledev/project-euler](https://github.com/thevilledev/project-euler).

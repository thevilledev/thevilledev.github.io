# Single Page Web Server

Yes, single-page applications are very _trendy_ these days. But why stop there? Instead of serving a self-contained web application, how about just serve the entire page as-is in a single request?
In this case, no JavaScript is envolved either, although it could be used. No matter what URI is requested, the web server always returns the same content.

It's HTTP 1.0 really. It's not very sophisticated either, but I had fun while making this.

# Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) presents math problems which can be solved programmatically. I use C, C++ or Python for these problems.

My solutions can be found from Github: [vtorhonen/project-euler](https://github.com/vtorhonen/project-euler).

# Stuff that I'm too lazy to write about

There are too many.

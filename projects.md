# Open source

Whenever I have the time I contribute to Github projects I personally use and like. Very often a HashiCorp repository.

# Automated deployments for Bitcoin Lightning network nodes

Project on Github: [thevilledev/lightning-node-ansible](https://github.com/thevilledev/lightning-node-ansible).

# Getting started with Vault

[Vault](https://vaultproject.io) solves the problem of secrets management and secure introduction in
a really neat way. My project [thevilledev/hashistack-pki](https://github.com/thevilledev/hashistack-pki)
introduces how Hashicorp's tools fit together and how you can utilize internal TLS certificates
easily within your own infrastructure.

# Single Page Web Server

Yes, single-page applications are very _trendy_ these days. But why stop there?
Instead of serving a self-contained web application, how about just serve the entire
page as-is in a single request? In this case, no JavaScript is envolved either,
although it could be used. No matter what URI is requested, the web server always
returns the same content.

It's HTTP 1.0 really. It's not very sophisticated either, but I had fun while making this.

Project on Github: [thevilledev/single-page-web-server](https://github.com/thevilledev/single-page-web-server).

# Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) presents math problems which can be solved programmatically. I use C, C++ or Python for these problems.

My solutions can be found from Github: [thevilledev/project-euler](https://github.com/thevilledev/project-euler).
